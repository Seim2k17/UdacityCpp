Purpose
----------

- vehicles have to wait at a n intersection until its their turn to drive
- we need to establish a one time communication channel btw. vehicles and connections using promises/future
-> we need a proper waiting mechanism so that at one point of time only a single vehicle is att the intersection

- to wait if a future is ready we create it as a result of async and then get it with get() -> this will only get it when the future is ready to use .....

-> does .get() has the same function as .wait() (blockingmechanism)  + getting it ?
